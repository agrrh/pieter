### 0.6 - Future is near

- [ ] Run jobs in containers?
- [ ] Master-workers model?

### 0.5 - Making it awesome

- [ ] Build UI
- [ ] Add stdout/stderr streams

### 0.4 - Now proud for sure

- [ ] Move repos out of `data.yml` and get rid of this file
- [ ] Use some lightweight storage (redis, etcd, ...)

### 0.3 - Start being proud

- [ ] Start testing it
- [ ] Write a good readme

### 0.2 - Still pile of crap, but with confetti now

- [ ] List scenarios when requesting `GET /repos/<repo_name>`
- [ ] Use `result = response.json()` instead of `code = ...; result = ...; return response.json(resuilt, status=code)`
- [ ] Use some classes

### 0.1 - This needs a repository

- [x] Bunch of crappy code just to prove it would work
