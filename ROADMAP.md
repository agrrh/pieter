### 0.5

I guess it's OK to mention project in my CV now.

- [ ] Run jobs in containers?
- [ ] Master-workers model?

### 0.4

Making it awesome.

- [ ] Build UI
- [ ] Add stdout/stderr streams

### 0.3

Start being proud.

- [ ] Use some lightweight storage (redis, etcd, ...)
- [ ] Move repos out of `data.yml` and get rid of this file
- [ ] Start testing it
- [ ] Write a good readme
- [ ] Move job files to `jobs/` instead of `logs/`

### 0.2

Still pile of crap, but with confetti now.

- [x] List scenarios when requesting `GET /repos/<repo_name>`
- [x] Use `result = response.json()` instead of `code = ...; result = ...; return response.json(resuilt, status=code)`
- [x] Use some classes
- [x] Create master branch

### 0.1

This needs a repository.

- [x] Bunch of crappy code just to prove it would work
